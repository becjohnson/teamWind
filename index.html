        I am currently a software dev at ElevenFifty Acedemy. My background is pretty diverse. I have been in the Military, worked as a bartender, fabricated metal for HVAC, and currently work retail.
        Every path I have gone down has led me to a new adventure in life filled with different experiences. Becoming a Software Developer is a goal in my life that I want to achieve in order to reach
        my next path in life.
