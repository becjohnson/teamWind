        I have a well rounded background. I have worked everything from call center at Chadwicks of Boston to 1800-Medicare to 
        direct support professional for adults with disabilities to Truck driver and a Substitute Teacher for elementary school 
        children. I am focused and driven to excel at what I am doing. I have been in the unique position that has allowed me to stay
        home and focus on my family which has given me to opportunity to learn new skills like the spreadsheet I have designed to track
        my husbands miles as well as rate of pay to keep track of what his paychecks are supposed to be and perfect that spreadsheet
        to the point that I am usually only off by no more than $20 a week unless something big happens on the payroll end. I am self 
        motivated and ready to learn. I work well with others and feel I do my best work when working with a team. Team work allows me
        to continue to learn as well as put my skills to use on projects. I have a personality that allows me to be organized and think 
        things through before I get started. I tend to do best when working with an outline or plan. I find that I structure myself in 
        all things so I have steps to follow to allow myself to remain organized and easily track what I have done and where I am going.
